# Pitchfork Score Analysis

This is an analysis of Pitchfork Magazine's album reviews. I was interested in understanding the magazine's music scores because I often read their reviews, and more than often, my opinions on music albums tend to not align with theirs. The repository contains code for SQL pull of the data from SQLite database through R, and analysis via Jupyter notebook. The dataset can be found on Kaggle.
